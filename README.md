# Equity in Post-HCT Survival Predictions

This repository contains a project that focuses on predicting post-hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) survival outcomes while considering equity across patient groups.
This notebook is used for [CIBMTR - Equity in post-HCT Survival Predictions](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/equity-post-HCT-survival-predictions/overview) Kaggle competition

## Project Overview

The project explores:
- Predictive modeling of post-HCT survival.
- Incorporating fairness into survival predictions.

It includes the following key components:
1. **Data Preprocessing:** Handling and preparing the dataset for analysis.
2. **Modeling:** Developing predictive models to estimate survival outcomes.
3. **Bias Assessment:** Analyzing the fairness of predictions across different demographic groups.
4. **Fairness Improvements:** Implementing strategies to enhance equity in predictions.

## Key Features

- End-to-end workflow for survival prediction modeling.
- Tools to assess model performance and fairness metrics.
- Evaluation Metrics:
  - Applied the Kaplan-Meier method for survival analysis.
  - Used Concordance Index (C-index) to evaluate predictive performance.
